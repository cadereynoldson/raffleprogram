# Raffle By Cade
Code contains a data structure designed to store .csv formatted data from google forms based raffle.\
Various methods are included if you'd like to hard code your raffle (importing data, export folder, etc.)\
Otherwise, use the current GUI (GUI V1) to load in your data. 
See the application instructions here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/198a5-hnS8HMOw5veUp64-v-1c8tMRJDCqJXl4N8v0bg/edit?usp=sharing
- GUI V1 allows users to raffle off various items, such as shoes, shirts, and everything in between. 
- GUI V2 (SCRAPPED)
- GUI V3 (IN DEVELOPMENT ~40% DONE)
